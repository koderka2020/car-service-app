# car-service-app


* Clear instructions on how to build and run the application
* Full source code located in a git repository or similar

 Please write this application as you would write normal production code, including appropriate comments, and using the proper format in javascript/node.js
 For this test please create a simple application with a REST API that can store and manage appointments for a car service center. Appointments should be persisted in a data store of your choice. Please create the data model that you feel is appropriate for the task at hand.
 The application should have REST endpoints that do the following:
* Create / Edit / Update / Delete appointments
* Retrieve single and multiple appointments based on dates, times, prices, items, etc.
 Additionally, an appointment scheduler function should create new appointments at a random interval.
 Things to consider
* User base
* User stories
* Deployment and Builds
* CI/CD
* Tests
* Front and back end usage
 It is okay to include other libraries/dependencies as necessary, but be prepared to discuss with your interviewer.
